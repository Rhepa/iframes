			<p>If you enjoyed the song, then maybe you're ready for a lengthy cat movie. It is a one hour film of kittens growing up. Just a warning, there's a birth scene in the beginning just in case you feel queasy. Did I really watch the whole thing? yes. Did I cry? yes. Was it super duper cute? absolutely. What is perfect?. NO. It was <strong> purrfect :,) </strong></p>

			<p>I'm assuming you probably didn't watch the whole thing. If you did, congrats! You are a true kitty fan. I have an entire collection of cat memes but unfortunately I cannot upload them all. Here's one. No, I'm not bashing dog lovers. I just thought this was funny. I'm also adding a link to a cat meme collection I found.

				<p>Last but not least, if you started liking cats more or enjoyed this content, how about considering adopting a cat? Check out <strong>TORONTO HUMANE SOCIETY</strong>. This is an animal shelter that I have visited before.  They have many adorables felines waiting to be adopted! There's also dogs :) (a puppy bit me. Ferocious puppy.) </p>
